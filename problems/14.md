## (14) Querying a Real-World P2P Database (IMDB)

Great job making it this far! Hopefully you are a little more familiar with key encodings now and how to create/query your own secondary indexes.
To test what we've learned against a real world dataset, we've inserted the [entire IMDB dataset](https://www.imdb.com/interfaces/), along with a couple of secondary indexes for ratings and keywords, into a Hyperbee.

The database is available at this public key:

```
1444f69f7a541e532f762c8f8847e14cc05c8b6b25886e333bc8e86e882f1033
```

This IMDB Hyperbee database contains three indexes.

One for the title ids:

```
ids!{imdbTitleId} -> metadataObject
```

An example title id is `tt8760684`. You can find your own by looking in the URL when looking at a movie or tv show on https://imdb.com.
The `metadataObject` is a JSON object containing stuff like the name of the movie, the rating, the genre, and more.

Another one for the entry ratings:

```
ratings!{lexint.pack(10 * rating, 'hex')}!${lexint.pack(ratingVotes, 'hex')}!${imdbTitleId} -> imdbTitleId
```

This one rank all entries by rating.
For example the title linked above, `tt8760684`, has a rating of `8.2` with `20736` votes. That means it's entry in this index looks like this:

```
ratings!{lexint.pack(82, 'hex')}!${lexint.pack(20736, 'hex')}!tt8760684 === ratings!52!fc5005!tt8760684
```

Finally there is one for title keywords, that looks like this:

```
keywords!{keyword.toLowerCase()}!lexint.pack(10 * rating, 'hex')!${imdbTitleId} -> imdbTitleId
```

For example the entry for "Game of Thrones" would have three keywords, `['game', 'of', 'thrones']`.

# Exercises

#### Exercise 1

Use the replicate method and the above public key to make a Hyperbee instance that replicates the remote IMDB dataset.
Make sure to set the valueEncoding for the Hyperbee itself to `json` as the values here are stored as JSON.

To test it try querying for:

```
ids!tt8760684
```

And see that it returns the correct result.

#### Exercise 2

Use the ratings index to find the 10 highest rated entries in the dataset.
Also use it to find the 10 lowest rated ones.

#### Exercise 3

Using the keyword index we can make a simple search API for the dataset to find entries.

Implement a function called `search(keyword)` that searches the keyword index for results containing a specific keyword by returning the result stream.

Since we include the rating in this index as well, you can use the `reverse` option to rank the search results by IMDB rating.

## Takeaways

Congratulations! You've reached the end of the guided part of the workshop. If you still have steam, the next exercise is more freeform, involving advanced (but very fun) queries on the IMDB dataset.

We hope these exercises have helped you develop a solid understanding of append-only logs, embedded indexes, and the Hypercore Protocol. If you're interested in exploring the latter, our [website](https://hypercore-protocol.org) or the [docs repo](https://github.com/hypercore-protocol/docs) would be good places to start.

Thanks for participating!
